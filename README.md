# Miguel Dario . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate from Ryerson University with a Bachelor of Commerce in Business Technology Management, where I was exposed to business fields such as data analytics, project management, as well as languages such as Python, R, and SQL. I am currently a Business Systems Analyst trainee for Jarvis where I applied the skills I have learned in work, and school such as requirements gathering, data concepts and documentation in addition to gaining new ones, namely Agile. I have previously worked as an intern for Manawa Networks where I developed strong stakeholder management skills through identifying gaps in client IT processes, and documenting IT standards. My passion, and ability to bridge the gap between technology and people make me a great fit for a Business Systems Analyst role.

**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MiguelDario/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MiguelDario/tree/main/linux_sql)]: Elicited requirements for a Linux Cluster Resource monitoring by meeting stakeholders such as the Cluster Administration team, Support Team, and Implementation team. Prepared a systems requirement document outlining the project scope, functional, and non-functional requirements, and data modelling to be used by the solution designer. Visualized the system architecture using draw.io The purpose of the system is to collect hardware information, and usage of each host and store it in an RDBMS for future planning purposes. The implementation consists of a monitoring agent with two bash scripts. One to collect hardware information, and another to monitor hardware usage every minute which will be automated using crontab. A PostgreSQL instance provisioned with Docker will be used to store the information.

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MiguelDario/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MiguelDario/tree/develop/python_data_analytics)]: Partnered with London Gift Shop (LGS) to address stagnant wage growth from LGS in recent years. Requirements include a proof-of-concept analytics solution that will analyze customer shopping behaviour. Analyzed using Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy and Matplotlib. Visualized the analysis using Jupyter Notebook. Data used for the project is sourced from a LGS' Azure SQL Server, and will be dumped into Jarvis' PostgreSQL data warehouse. The Jupyter Notebook and database are Dockerized. The analysis will be used by LGS' marketing team to create new marketing campaigns, and attract new customers.

**Hadoop** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MiguelDario/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MiguelDario/tree/develop/hadoop)]: Evaluated the performance of various Hadoop and is various components such as MapReduce, YARN, and HDFS. Provisioned a Hadoop Cluster using Dataproc consisting of 1 master node, and 2 worker nodes. Loaded the data into HDFS and, analyzed using Apache Hive. Performed various tasks on the data such as partitioning in order to optimize query performance, and compare execution time. Results are displayed in a Zeppelin Notebook.


## Highlighted Projects
**Final Year Capstone Project**: Designed an IS solution with a group of 6 students for a fictitious tool rental company to meet business needs. Elicited requirements from product owner which was to ensure the flexibility to meet the rental needs of major construction companies. Utilized Visio to design business process maps, and diagrams using BPMN, and UML standards to visualize the new IS solution. Conceptualized use cases using the user story method. Regularly met with project sponsor to update on project milestones, and discuss improvements in final product. Presented the final product to the product owner.

**Business Intelligence and Analytics Final Course project**: Utilized R to analyze a dataset for a fictitious Portuguese bank to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. Explored the data by plotting graphs representing customer age, and contact duration distribution. Analyzed the dataset using K nearest, and decision trees. Wrote a report outlining, the project objective, learning methods used, and findings in the data. Presented to the class using Google Slides.

**Big Data Analytics Final Course project**: Utilized Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn) to analyze a dataset of Mashable articles to predict the popularity of an article based on the number of shares on social media, and an online shopping dataset to predict if a user will end up buying something. Explored data splitting the data into training, and test datasets, and removing any blank rows. Implemented using k-nearest neighbour, decision trees, and support vector machine. Wrote a report outlining, the project objective, learning methods used, and findings in the data. Presented to the class using Google Slides.

**On-boarding process documentation**: Documentation of Manawa Networks' on-boarding process. The basic process consists of configuring up a new or existing workstation for an employee, creating their accounts in Microsoft 365, and the Active Directory, downloading requested applications, and shipping the workstation. Gathered requirements from Director of Technology Success. The main requirement of this document was for it to be written in such a way that anyone can understand and follow instructions without any help.
