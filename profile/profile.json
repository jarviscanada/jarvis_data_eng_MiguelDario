Prepared a systems requirement document outlining the project scope, functional, and non-functional requirements, and data modelling to be used by the solution designer. Visualized the system architecture using draw.io The purpose of the system is to collect hardware information, and usage of each host and store it in an RDBMS for future planning purposes. The implementation consists of a monitoring agent with two bash scripts. One to collect hardware information, and another to monitor hardware usage every minute which will be automated using crontab. A PostgreSQL instance provisioned with Docker will be used to store the information.",

I have previously worked as an intern for Manawa Networks where I developed strong stakeholder management skills through regularly meeting with clients to discuss gaps in their IT processes and how they can be improved using Manawa's IT solutions. In the same job, I was responsible for documenting various IT systems and standards. I have a passion for technology and enjoy learning about new technologies and how to make sense of it. I also enjoy interacting with a wide range of clients, learning about their business problems, and providing solutions to those through technology. I believe that these combined make me a great fit for a Business Systems Analyst role."
