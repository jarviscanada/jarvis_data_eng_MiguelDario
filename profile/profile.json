I am currently a Business Systems Analyst trainee for Jarvis where I applied the skills I have learned in work, and school such as requirements gathering, data concepts, and documentation in addition to gaining new ones, namely Agile. I have previously worked as an intern for Manawa Networks where I developed strong stakeholder management skills by identifying gaps in client IT processes, and documenting IT standards. My passion, and ability to bridge the gap between technology and people make me a great fit for a Business Systems Analyst role."
