  "summary": "My name is Miguel Dario, and I Graduated from the Business Technology Management program at Ryerson University, where I was exposed to fields such as data analytics, project management, and networking. I have previously worked as an intern for Manawa Networks where I developed strong client management skills through providing IT solutions. In the same job, I was responsible for documenting various IT systems and standards. I have a passion for technology and enjoy learning about new technologies and how to make sense of it. I also enjoy interacting with a wide range of clients, learning about their business problems, and providing solutions to those through technology. I believe that these combined make me a great fit for a Business Systems Analyst role."
